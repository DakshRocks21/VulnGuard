# VulnGuard
> V1 maybe?

## Description

As GitHub gets increasingly utilised by developers, there is a growing probability of receiving commits from ill-minded users with malicious intentions. As such, developers are required to constantly review pull requests which requires a lot of manual work. Therefore, we decided to come up with an AI embedded code checker that checks for potential vulnerabilities and creating automated test cases.

## Features

- Vulnerability Analysis
  - Generates an analysis report of new commitments to a repository in about 1 minute.
- Automated Test Case Generation
  - Automatically generates test cases to prove that suggested changes work as intended.
